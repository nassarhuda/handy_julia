# handy_julia
some julia functions I happen to use repetitively 

To quickly use these functions... Here's a fast way to do it.

```
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/nassarhuda/handy_julia")

julia> include(joinpath(Pkg.dir(),"handy_julia","handy_julia.jl"))
```

Alternatively, you can download the file `handy_julia.jl` and include it.
